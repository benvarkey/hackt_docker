From the top-level folder, do

- docker-compose build hackt
- docker-compose run --rm hackt

Once inside the container, do

- install_hackt.sh

Now you should have HACKT compiled and installed under `/usr/local` inside the container.
The compiled binaries are persistently saved in the host machine under `<parent>/local`.
